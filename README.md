# Open-Source and Improvised RCA-based Clustering

This repository is contains an open-source, imrpovised Reversible Cellular Automata based clustering technique. 

---

# Getting Started

1. Install the requirements using the ```requirements.txt``` file through the command : 

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. The ```cluster.ipynb``` notebook contains the sample code for running the clustering technique. 

3. Make sure your database is included in the ```data``` folder before clustering, as the function takes dataset name as input. 

4. The function currently runs on 4 threads by default and runs 10 trails befoer showing the best results.
